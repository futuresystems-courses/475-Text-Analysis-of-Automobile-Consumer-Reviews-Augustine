1. edmunds1.py

	This source code is for the unsupervised text analysis. The file will automatically pull dataset 
using API calls to edmunds.com Vehicle API. The computer that runs this code should have
internet connection and the libraries listed above should be installed on it. This will print the results
of the text analysis to the console. The code should run on any OS that has above mentioned libraries 
installed. 



2. edmunds2.py

	This source code is to run the supervised text analysis. The code will automaticlly pull 
dataset using API calls to edmunds.com Vehicle API. The computer that runs this code should have
internet connection and the libraries listed above should be installed on it. This will print the results
of the text analysis to the console. It will also plot the results. The code should run on any OS that 
has above mentioned libraries installed.
